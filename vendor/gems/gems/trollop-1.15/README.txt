Documentation quickstart: See Trollop::options (for some reason rdoc isn't
linking that; it's in the top right of the screen if you're browsing online)
and then Trollop::Parser#opt. Also see the examples at
http://trollop.rubyforge.org/.

== DESCRIPTION

Trollop is a commandline option parser for Ruby that just gets out of your
way. One line of code per option is all you need to write. For that, you get a
nice automatically-generated help page, robust option parsing, command
subcompletion, and sensible defaults for everything you don't specify.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS

- Dirt-simple usage.
- Sensible defaults. No tweaking necessary, much tweaking possible.
- Support for long options, short options, short option bundling, and
  automatic type validation and conversion.
- Support for subcommands.
- Automatic help message generation, wrapped to current screen width.
- Lots of unit tests.

== REQUIREMENTS

* A burning desire to write less code.

== INSTALL

* gem install trollop
